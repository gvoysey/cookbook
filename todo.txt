there are a lot of warnings in the compilation output. i'd like to get rid of
them. they appear to be connected to not having the recipes in sections? but
that's bullshit.

the linking inside the document doesn't work that well. all the links in a
section jump to the head of that section, not to the actual recipe.

i'm not convinced that having the perl in its own file is the right way to do
this, or that i've written the best perl possible. maybe some unix hackery or
make stuff would better?

i should make the list.pl file aware of sections, subsections, etc. i'm not
sure if file::find is robust enough to do this or if i need more access to the
guts of the recusrion.

it might be worth it to write list.pl in a much more general way, as a module
that maps directories to tex. something to think about. may end up doing it
either way.
