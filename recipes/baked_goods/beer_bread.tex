  In a large bowl,  mix together sugar and flour. Add beer and continue to
  mix, first with a wooden spoon, then hands. Pour into a $9\times 5$ greased
  loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 50 to 60 minutes. The top should be crunchy.

\textit{An excellent way to dispose of unwanted beer. Works very differently
  with different beers: Victory Moonglow isn't at all bad, Penn Pilsner is
  very fluffy; most stouts are heavy and bitter.}
