  In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder,

  mixture resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl, combine the
  molasses, milk, and egg yolk until smooth. Stir into the flour mix
  until just moistened. Turn out on to a floured surface, and knead
  6-8 times. Pat into a round mound about 8" in diameter. Cut into 12
