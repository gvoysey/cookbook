\begin{recipe}{All-Purpose Scones}{Marian Walke}{20 Mins}
  \ing[1]{lb}{flour}
  \ing[2]{tbsp}{sugar}
  \ing[4]{tsp}{baking powder}
  \ing[\fr14]{tsp}{salt}
  \ing[1]{stick}{softened butter}
  \ing[5]{oz}{currants}
  \ing[$\leq$10]{oz}{milk}

  Optionally, wet and briefly heat currants to plump them. Add
  together dry ingredients and currants. With a fork, add in butter
  until evenly distributed. Add milk in 2 oz increments, slowly
  stirring. Stop once all the dry ingredients have been absorbed;
  dough should be pliable, but still pretty wet and sticky. Split
  dough in half, and mush each half in to a flattened cylinder. Cut 6
  isosceles wedges from each. Bake at 450\0F for 10 mins, or until
  golden brown.
  
  For best results, treat the dough very gently.  Mixing should ideally be done by hand and to the minimal degree necessary.
\end{recipe}
\textit{Note that most anything can be used instead of currants:
  walnut halves; dried cherries, blueberries, or cranberries; cinnamon
  chips; \&c.}
