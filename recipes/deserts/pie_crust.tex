\begin{recipe}{Standard Pie Crust}{Helen Voysey}{10 minuets}
  \ing[1]{cup}{unbleached flour}
  \ing[\fr12]{tsp}{salt}
  \ing[1\fr13]{tbsp}{hard shortening}
  \ing[2-3]{\textit{cold}}{club soda or seltzer}

  Mix the salt and flour. Cut Shortening into the flour mixture until no
  longer visible; it should resemble coarse meal. Add club soda to this
  1 Tbsp at a time. The dough should be pliable and easy to manage,
  and you can adjust that by adding more club soda. Roll out on to a
  floured sheet of wax paper. Peel paper off the back as you drape
  dough over your arm.
\end{recipe}
\textit{If you are making a double crust, do not attempt to double
  these numbers. Make two separate batches. This crust fits an 8 or 9
  inch pie pan.}
