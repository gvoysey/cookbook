\begin{recipe}{Nian Gao, ``Red Bean Sticky Cake''}{Vincent Zeng}{50 minutes}
  \ing[\fr34]{lb.}{glutinous rice flour}
  \ing[1]{large}{egg}
  \ing[\fr12]{cup}{vegetable oil}
  \ing[1]{cup}{milk}
  \ing[\fr12]{cup}{brown sugar}
  \ing[\fr12]{cup}{hot water from boiling red beans}
  \ing[\fr12]{cup}{smushed well-cooked red beans}

  PREP: Cook off about a cup of dry red beans by simmering until the beans mush easily. Have just enough water in the pot to keep the beans covered, adding more water later as needed. Save the hot water. Leftover beans can be used as a top garnish.

  Mix glutinous rice flour, egg, oil, and milk well. Dissolve the sugar into the hot red bean water and add to batter mixture. Add the smushed red beans and mix well. The batter should be about standard yellow cake batter consistency; make adjustments by either adding more flour or more red bean water until it feels right.

  Pour into a lined or greased 8x8 pan and bake for about 45 minutes at 350$^{\circ}$F.
