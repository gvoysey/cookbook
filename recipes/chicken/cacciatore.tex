  Heat a small amount of olive oil in a deep pan. Fry the garlic in the oil,
  being careful not to burn it. Brown both sides of the chicken in the same
  pan. Put in the crushed tomatoes, mixing with water so that the chicken is
  totally covered. Add spices to taste. Bring the whole mixture to a boil, put
  a lid on it, and let it simmer for a half hour. Serves well with rice.
