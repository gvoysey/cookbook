\begin{recipe}{Pork Normandy}{Graham Voysey}{1h 20 mins}
  \ing{2 oz}{butter}
  \ing{2+ lb}{pork tenderloin}
  \ing{7 oz}{streaky bacon, chopped}
  \ing{16}{whole peeled shallots}
  \ing{2}{celery sticks, chopped}
  \ing{0.5 pt}{dry hard cider (to taste)}
  \ing{0.5 pt}{chicken stock (to taste)}
  \ing{6 Tbsp}{cr\'eme fra\^iche}
  \ing{2 Tbsp}{corn mean mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water}
  \ing{2 Tbsp}{whole-grain Dijon mustard}
  \ing{2 Tbsp}{tarragon, fresh}

  Heat the oven to 170 C, 150 C fan, 325 F, gas 3. Heat half the butter in
  the casserole dish, add half the pork, season and fry for about 10
  minutes until thoroughly browned. Remove the meat from the pot with a
  slotted spoon and reserve. Add the rest of the butter to the casserole
  and fry the rest of the pork for 10 minutes until evenly browned.

  Meanwhile, in another pan, dry-fry the lardons until crispy. Remove, set
  aside, then fry the shallots, onion and celery for a few minutes, to
  soften slightly.

  Combine all the pork, the lardons, shallots, onion and celery in the
  casserole. Pour over the cider and chicken stock to cover. Cover the dish
  and cook in the oven for 2 hours until the pork is tender.

  Add the cr\'eme fra\^iche, cornflour mix, mustard and tarragon to the
  pan. Heat on the hob and stir until the sauce has thickened slightly
