\begin{recipe}{Sausages in Pottage}{adapted from Ouverture de Cuisine (1604)}{1 hour}
  \ing{5}{apples, baking}
  \ing{5}{onions, any kind}
  \ing{2 lb.}{pork sausage, any kind}
  \ing{}{nutmeg}
  \ing{}{cinnamon}
  \ing{8-10 oz}{beer}
   {\it Take sausages, \& fry them in butter, then take four or five peeled apples \& cut into small quarters, \& four or five onions cut into rings, \& fry them in butter, \& put all of them into a pot with the sausages, \& put therein nutmeg, cinnamon, with red or white wine, sugar, \& let them then all stew. }
   
   Brown sausages, sliced onions, and apples in as many frying pans as required.  Remove apples and onions once slightly softened into a \~10 qt. pot.  Add sausages, and beer for liquid, and then stew until delicious (approximately 2-3 hours).  If this is done on the stove top, keep at a simmer.  In the oven, approximately 375F seems to work well.

{\it The above is a very ad-hoc recpie, so there are a lot of substitutions
  that can be made.}
