  If you feel like throwing the unfinished drinks from last night, nobody will
  notice. Mix everything together and serve from jugs that have some ice in
  them. Remember GP4 and cut all the corners you can: Spanish white, cocktail
  gin, non-cognac but not non-French brandy, British sherry and British
  vermouth; the cider will cover them and blend them into a splendid new
  whole. Despite the potency that lurks behind its seeming mildness, I have
  never known anybody to suffer while or after drinking it.
