\begin{recipe}{Irish Cream}{SCA Cordials; Graham Voysey}{1 weeks}
  \ing[3]{large}{eggs, beaten}
  \ing[1]{pint}{heavy whipping cream}
  \ing[1]{can}{sweetened condensed milk}
  \ing[1]{tbsp}{honey}
  \ing[1]{tbsp}{chocolate syrup}
  \ing[1]{cup}{Jameson's Whiskey}
  
  Mix eggs, condensed milk, and cream throughly. Add honey and chocolate to
  taste. Add the whiskey last. Mix until totally smooth, taking care to whip
  the fat in the cream. You must age the cream for at least a week in the
  fridge; it must always be kept cold. You should shake it daily to ensure
  that it stays well mixed.
\end{recipe}
\textit{See \underline{Joy of Cooking} chocolate syrup recipe. Damn shame to
  use something like Hershey's after all that work. This yields about 1.3
  quarts, depending on the size of the eggs, how carefully you measure things,
  how much evaporates during the aging process, and how much is lost to daily
  mixing.}
