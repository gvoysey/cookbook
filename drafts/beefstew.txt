Beef stew: The beef you use is up to you. I got to buying a cheap steak and
cutting it up into globblets. If you get "stewing" meat you are buying a lot
of fat, grissle and prep time to cut it all off. And you end up with less meat
in the pot. Your choice.


1 - 11/2 lb cubed beef: Brown the meat in a frying pan (this isnt
      necessary,but does improve the meat somehow)

Carrots - cut
      or use those baby onions

onion - cut into bite sized pieces (dehydrated works well too)

garlic to your tastes I like the pre chopped garlic best (convienent and
flavorful)

28 oz can of chopped tomatoes (stewed work fine but you have to cut them down
to size)

1/4 cup dry (uncooked) barley

oregano - I use these free hand
basil - I use these free hand

in the last hour add
1 - 1/2 cups cut green beans or peas                   
any other "sturdy" firm vegie you may have around (hmmmm)

The late addition keeps these from cooking too long and going army green, they
add flavor, even if you aren't fond of them solo, they make the stew.

If you find it too thick, add liquid. Beer works really nicely, as does white
wine. Just remember the old addage: If you aren't willing to drink it, don't
put it in the pot.  cook at low for the day
