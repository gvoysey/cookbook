Rosemary Chicken

Use a whole chicken (the notations "fryer",  "baking", " Stewing" dont mean much more than                                        size of the bird.) 
Or - larger cut up chicken pieces.
Rinse the meat cut off all the fat.
rub it generously  with olive oil
place it in the center of the pot with slicec of lemonall around
liberally treat it to fresh rosemary (available in the section near lettuce and stuff)
have about 1/2 inch of water in the bottom of the pot (white wine works nicely if you want that
                        flavor added.
cook at low for the day
