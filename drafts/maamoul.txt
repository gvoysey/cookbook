this shit is still being mega-tweaked; proceed with caution

spice mix:
6 parts cinnamon
5 parts allspice
2 parts mahlab
2 parts nutmeg
1 part ginger
1 part anise
1 part fennel
1 part clove

date filling:
350 g date paste
2 tbsp spice mix
2 tbsp canola oil

dough:
4 c. semolina
1 c. flour
1 c. sugar
2 tsp instant yeast
1/4 tsp salt
1 c. ghee
1 3/5 c water

baking:
press a ball of dough into mold so there's an indentation in the middle and
the dough mostly covers the sides. press a ball of filling into the hole.
cover with another ball of dough and press to seal. no filling should be
visible, and the dough should dome out of the mold a little. tap the mamoul
out of the mold and put on a cookie sheet. bake at 350Fish for 20ish
minutes. they should brown a little bit. better when eaten cold.
