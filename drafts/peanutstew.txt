West African Groundnut Soup  (stew)

2 full chicken breasts (from one chicken) 
         cut these into pieces that will cook up to bite size
         saute the pieces until they are cooked on the outside, some goldy color is good.
Put the chicken into the crock pot - then add 
1  med to large onion - chopped and sauted
chunk of fresh ginger - about 1/4 of a pound - sliced and cut into pieces
3-4 cloves of garlic
2   3-4" jalapino peppers cut up into pieces
1 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp red pepper
1/2 tsp salt ( more can be added later)
1 can chopped tomatoes
1 generous cup peanut butter ( you use the right kind) natural-fresh. 
1/2 a can of tomato paste

Cook on low for the day.
some people put vegies into this, but I never have. They tend to get over cooked and nasty. 
I think I got everything. 

If you feel the need to thin this down, beer works as well as water
I serve this with either rice or rice noodles.
