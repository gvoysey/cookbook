this massive cookbook.tex file should be refactored before commiting it to SVN
to share with graham. it would be nice if the directory structure mirrored the
internal strucutre of the document.

i'm not sure if it should be one recipie per file. certainly the granularity
shouldn't be any lower than that. that allows the most flexibility with
eventual structures of the document, and makes automated refactoring less
painful. the recipies should never change; just their order.
